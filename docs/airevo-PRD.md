- Accessibility: dynamic type, VoiceOver/TalkBack, color contrast AA
- Security: secure storage for tokens; PII minimization; encryption in transit

---

## 9) Architecture & Tech
- Client: Expo (React Native, TypeScript) - aligns with current repo structure
- Local storage: SQLite or MMKV for speed + Redux/RTK Query or Zustand for state
- Sync backend (v1 option A): Supabase or Firebase; anonymous auth supported
- Notifications: Expo Notifications with server scheduling for personalized nudges
- Analytics: Expo Analytics (Segment/Amplitude compatible) + Sentry for crashes

Key modules (client):
- `features/onboarding/*`
- `features/dashboard/*`
- `features/plan/*`
- `features/cravings/*`
- `features/triggers/*`
- `features/education/*`
- `services/notifications.ts`, `services/analytics.ts`, `services/storage.ts`

- `POST /v1/logs/craving`
- `POST /v1/notifications/schedule`
- Rate limits and auth via JWT

---

## 12) Personalization Logic (examples)
- Risk hours: from craving logs; schedule nudges 15-30 min prior next day
- Lesson recommendations: based on last 3 craving triggers and plan stage
- Badge cadence: earlier wins concentrated in first 14 days

---

## 13) Analytics Events

- quit_date_set, plan_mode_selected
- craving_started, craving_completed, craving_lapse_logged
- breathing_started, breathing_completed

---

## 15) Privacy, Legal, Compliance

- Explicit consent for notifications and analytics
- Data deletion/export self-service
- Avoid sensitive medical data beyond self-report; minimize PII

---

## 16) Release Plan & Milestones
- M0 (Week 0-1): Foundations - navigation, theme, storage, analytics
- M1 (Week 2-3): Onboarding + baseline save + quit date
- M2 (Week 4-5): Dashboard + quit plan + notifications basic
- M3 (Week 6-7): Cravings tools + logging + insights basics
- M4 (Week 8): Education library + badges, polish, QA
- Beta: 50-100 users TestFlight/Closed testing
- GA: Store listings, support docs, marketing site

---

## 17) Acceptance Criteria (examples)
- User can complete onboarding in <= 8 minutes with autosave.
- User can set/edit a quit date and see countdown/days smoke-free.
- Craving flow runs a timer and records intensity/trigger; data appears in insights.
- Dashboard shows accurate money/time saved using baseline inputs.
- Notifications respect quiet hours and opt-outs.
- All core features work offline; sync resumes when online.

---

## 18) Implementation Guide for Current Repo (Expo)
Screens to add under `app/`:
- `app/onboarding/*` (stack): welcome, profile, dependence, triggers, motivations, quit_date, summary
- `app/(tabs)/dashboard.tsx` (replace `index.tsx` if desired)
- `app/craving/*`: timer, breathing, log
- `app/plan/*`: checklist, tasks
- `app/education/*`: list, detail
- `app/settings/*`

Shared:
- `components/ui/*`: cards, progress ring, breathing animation
- `constants/metrics.ts`: calculation helpers
- `services/*`: `storage.ts`, `analytics.ts`, `notifications.ts`

State:
- Use Zustand or Redux Toolkit; persist with MMKV/AsyncStorage

---

## 19) Onboarding Questionnaire (Field Spec)
- cigsPerDay: number (0-60)
- cigsPerPack: number (default 20)
- packPrice: number (currency configurable)
- timeToFirstCig: enum ["within_5m","5_30m","31_60m",">60m"]
- yearsSmoking: number (0-60)
- attemptsPastYear: number (0-10)
- triggers: string[] (pre-set + custom)
- motivations: string[] (top 3)
- readiness: number (0-10)
- confidence: number (0-10)
- quitDate: iso
- planMode: enum ["cold_turkey","reduction"]
- usingNRT: boolean; nrtTypes: string[]
- hasSupporter: boolean; supporterName:string?; reminders:boolean

---

## 20) Risks & Mitigations
- Low retention after week 1 -> increase early wins, daily challenges, coach upsell later.
- Over-notification -> granular controls + smart pacing + quiet hours.
- Data loss risk offline -> queue + robust local persistence + e2e tests.

---

## 21) Open Questions
- Monetization for v1? (ads vs subscription vs free)
- Which backend (Supabase vs Firebase) - decide at M0

---

## 22) Appendix: Sample Copy
- Craving tip: "Urges peak in 3-5 minutes. Start the timer and breathe with us."
- Badge copy: "First 24 hours smoke-free - your lungs thank you."
