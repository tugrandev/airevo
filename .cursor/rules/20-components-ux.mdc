# Components & UX
- One primary button per screen. Secondary = outline; Tertiary = text-only.
- Inputs: label above, inline validation, min tap 44x44.
- Cards: group KPIs/checklists; low density; radius 12px; subtle Level 1 elevation.
- Lists/Rows: title + optional meta + chevron when navigates; 56–64px height.
- Chips/Tags: for triggers/motivations; wrap to 2 lines max.
- Progress Ring: use for urge timer/milestones; avoid fullscreen spinners.
- Badges: minimal glyph + short label; celebrate inline, avoid blocking modals.

Screen guidance:
- Onboarding: single-purpose steps, progress indicator, autosave, ask name early.
- Dashboard: top stat (countdown/days smoke‑free), 3–4 KPIs max, 1–3 tasks, one lesson card.
- Cravings: urge timer first, quick breathing/reframes, log outcome succinctly.

Platform:
- iOS: back swipe, large titles on top-level.
- Android: ripple feedback, hardware back support.
