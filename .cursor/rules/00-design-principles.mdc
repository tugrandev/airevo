# Design Principles
- Clarity over decoration; keep only elements that guide a decision or action.
- Calm confidence; neutral surfaces, limited accent, generous whitespace.
- One primary action per screen; make the next step unmistakable.
- Friendly, never cute; supportive tone without jokes or slang.
- Accessible by default; contrast, touch targets, dynamic type, screen readers.
- Offline-first UX; show state clearly and sync gracefully when online.
